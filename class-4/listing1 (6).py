1. The user will not be prompted with any text Blank space with awaiting cursor 
2. The data type of the variable i is not determined; Basic Property of Python; 
3. The output of input() always is in string datatype; If it is expected in specific data type, you have to typecaste is 
int(), float(), ... 

Data Type of the variable: type(variable)

>>> #how can we get the remainder
>>> 5/2
2.5
>>> #/ --> Arithmeic Division
>>> 5//2
2
>>> #// --> Integer division (Result is integer type)
>>>
>>> 5 % 2
1
>>> # % --> Remainder Operator

Let r be remainder when p is divided by q. 
Constraint on r: 
r belogs to 0 to q-1 
if youre dividing any number by 
a) 2 ==> Remainder would be 1 or 0 
b) 11 ==> Remainder would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10  #set of remainder class {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} 
is called as residue modulo 
c) 100 ==> Remaiders would be 0 to 99
