Composition of function 
f(x) = sin x 
g(x) = cos x 
f(g(x)) = sin (cos x)
f(f(x)) = sin (sin x) // Recursion 


Three Types of Recursion 
1. Tail Recursion :- Final Statement --> Recursive Call 
2. Head Recursion :- Staring of the program --> Recursive Call 
3 .Tree Recursion :- Tree like growing of Computation --> Recursive Call 

//Memoisation
intermediate :- Intermediate Storage 


//List, Tuples and Dictionary 
// List: [] 
// Tuples: ()
// set and Dictionary: {}
